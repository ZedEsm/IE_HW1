- Proposing new features

## In This Project We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.


## We Use Pull Request
They are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://github.com/ZedEsm/IE_HW1)). I actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Commit your changes, then push the branch to your fork with `git push -u fork` and open a pull request on [IE_HW1](https://github.com/ZedEsm/IE_HW1).
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

### Any contributions you make will be under the GNU GPLv3  License

### Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/ZedEsm/IE_HW1/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy ;)

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
    - Be specific!
    - What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
